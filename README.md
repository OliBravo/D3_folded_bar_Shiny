# D3_folded_bar_Shiny
This is the first shiny app using D3.js library. Live demo: https://appforiarteam.shinyapps.io/D3_folded_bar/ 

* Simply click the bar in the chart or the dropdown tab to guide you to a monthly chart of clicked airflight. Then click "ALL" in the tab to reset. 

* You can write down the note or suggestions in the text box (support Markdown syntax), and your note will be print in a summary report (pdf or word)!

* This app demonstrates the power of using `R2D3` package which can link your data (in R) to D3.js script. 

* The note box part used `noteMD` R package (`devtools::install_github("jienagu/noteMD")`). Repos: https://github.com/jienagu/noteMD
